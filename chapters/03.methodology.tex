Materials and Methods is the chronological listing of steps and procedure/s used by the proponent/s. Methods used for gathering of data, laboratory and field experiment, theoretical and/or conceptual frameworks, as well as techniques employed in the analyses of data must be specifically listed. 

\section{Software Design, Products and/or Processes}


\section{System Architecture}


\section{Conceptual Design}
This section represents the application as a conceptual entity-relationship model. Verification of the conceptual design is required (usually included in the Results and Discussion chapter) to ensure that all needed data has been acquired and that it supports all processes identified in the requirement specifications.

\section{Cost Benefit Analysis}
This section estimates the cost of software, hardware and labor required by the application of the project. It should compare the cost to implement such an application with the benefits delivered by the application. It should also demonstrate the values added to a given institution by the application of the project.
